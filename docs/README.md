# Space Invaders

A JavaScript built game with some basic HTML and CSS.

# HOW TO PLAY

Advance through the levels using the arrow keys for movement and the spacebar to shoot the alien invaders. Also, don't let them escape, because they are headed to destroy planet earth.

# HOW TO INSTALL

# HOW IT WORKS

The game is built using several methods and will continue to use more as I keep adding to this game.

  • setInterval()
  • clearInterval()
  • push()
  • indexOf()
  • includes()
  • classList
  • querySelector()
  • addEventListener()
  • Switch cases
  • keyCodes


# FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

The goal is to add several games to this screen making an arcade of games. I will use these games for reference in the future and set-up practice folders so I can practice building these games without any references.
